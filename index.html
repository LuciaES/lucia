        <div class= "infome" > <h3 style="color:white;font-family:fantasy;font-weight:lighter;">I had my Akashic Records read to me for the first time many years ago when I was at a breaking point in my life, like many other and so it began me discovery of the all wise akashic world. The reading made me feel connected with something higher then myself and it gave me the hope I needed to start creating personal changes.
        <br><br>
        I had been given a gift in form of information, allowing me to enjoy my life and understand it better. I knew then that I wanted to do the same thing for others.
        <br><br>
        Thanks to that life experience, I have been an Akashic Records reader for 8 years now.
        I enjoy and learn so much from assisting these readings and I can't help but to feel happy and uplifted once a reading is over. The feeling that you helped someone feel better, is amazing!
        <br><br>
        Thank you masters, librarians and beings of light for allowing me to work with the Akashic Records everyday. For opening my eyes and helping me live  a more present life.</h3></div>
