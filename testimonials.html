  <p>I highly recommend an akashic reading with Lucia. The experience gave me clear insights into my soul purpose and a strong sense of direction in my career and relationships. Lucia was so kind and heartfelt - she explained the process step-by-step and took time to answer all my questions. The predictions made were completely accurate and I found the reading very reassuring in my daily life. I cannot wait for the next one! Thank you Lucia for sharing your amazing gift! âœ¨<br>

  <p>I heard about Lucia from a friend, in the right moment of my life .I was nor happy nor unhappy , I was just floating with no purpose and a sense of wanting something else ....not to mention a very vague frustration....tho I have to mention I was living at that time in a beautiful island .
  <br>
  After my meeting with Lucia , I came out lighter like I dropped a heavy weight off my shoulders. Everything had changed. I got my sparkle back and SUDDENLY everything was making sense again ,the puzzle that  I call life was starting to get a shape.
  And so it began my first conscious step of my quest in finding and fulfilling my purpose.I left my job after few months ,left the island  and decided to take one sabatical year. ( all this made sense and was so much easier to do after my meeting with Lucia ).Once I stepped on my path  I felt happier and I realized leaving was the best thing I could have ever done for my life at that time .
  <br>
  I have contacted Lucia , two more times after that and every time, at times I felt I needed it ,to get guidance and reassurance I was doing things right .
  <br>
  Now again I'm on the brink of another step in my path to my destiny and I can say I trust things will fall into place because I m not only listening to what  Lucia had to comunicate from my masters to me,  but also to my intuition.
  <br>
  She has influenced in good many ppl lives and even tho in the begining I was definetely sceptical about all that she was supposed to be able to do , I came out not only convinced about the reality of what she is doing but also so much more open to everything good that the universe has to offer for me .
  <br>
  When we really need help someone or something will appear to guide us to , nudge us in the right direction. After that is all up to us.
  <br>
  Forgot to mention ...Lucia is a really sweet caring person that does things from her heart and it shows. She takes her time to really explain when things are not clear and she will answer to as many questions as she can.<br>
